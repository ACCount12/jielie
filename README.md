# JieLi STUFF

I have been sorta an JieLi maniac since 2013?! But actually it's more like 2019.

- xx.08.2018 - mp3 player with **AC1187** yet again, revisit with a 12 year old mind...
- 27.12.2018 - the mp3 bluetooth disco ball thing illuminate from XL12345.COM based on **AC6908C** (AS16AP16368-8C4)
- 08.02.2019 - the super 4k (no way, GC0307 == 640x480) wifi action dash sport dv camera based on **AC5204A**
- 28.12.2020 - the mp3 stroboscope from XL12345.COM based on **AC1082**
